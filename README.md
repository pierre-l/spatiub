Spatiub
=======

Introduction
------------

Spatiub is an experimental project aiming at solving the following issue: maintain a swarm of clients controlling entities on a virtual map aware of the actions of every entity in the vicinity. This is in fact a publish-subscribe system dedicated to spatial events.


Status
------

The project is in its infancy. It is undocumented and need more benchmarks before any more work is performed to make it a real software product.

Actually, the only reason for it to be available on Github right now is to facilitate the execution of these benchmark on cloud providers.
